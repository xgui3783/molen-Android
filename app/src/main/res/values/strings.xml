        <b>Some known bugs/quirks of Optical Structure Recognition:</b>\n\n
        • it only works (sometimes) on condensed structural formulae (sorry),\n
        • it sometimes mishandles isomers (1-propanol intepreted as isopropanol),\n
        • it does not work exceptionally-well/at-all on large molecules.\n
        • what we are trying to say is, if you can load the molecule via .mol file, do so.\n\n

        <b>Why do some .mol files display molecules in 3D, but some do not?</b>\n\n
        • because calculating the 3D coordinates of a given molecule is real hardwork, and\n
        • most of the time, .mol files are only required to display a 2D chemical structure any way (chemdraw, etc)\n\n

        <b>To determine if a .mol file is 2D or 3D, simply render it.</b>\n\n

        <b>Why is the main app in a landscape configuration?</b>\n\n
        • molen carry out image manipulation using openCV. The Android implementation of openCV defaults to a landscape output. We are looking at writing a custom interface in the future to fix this.\n\n

        <b>What about custom AR markers?</b>\n\n
        • As far as we can tell, fitting a custom AR marker is extremely finicky. There are no immediate plans to implement custom AR markers.
